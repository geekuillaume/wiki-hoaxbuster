Wiki HoaxBuster is a Chrome Extension that allows you to better see pages revisions and bust unrelialable information.

It has been developped during the 2015 edition of WikiMedia Hackthon.

It uses the [Wikiwho](https://github.com/maribelacosta/wikiwho) [API](http://people.aifb.kit.edu/ffl/wikiwho/).

To install it, just clone the repo and add the `app` as an unpacked application in Chrome.

## Contribute

The extension has been started from the Yeoman [Chrome Extension Generator](https://github.com/yeoman/generator-chrome-extension).

It uses [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) and [Browserify](http://browserify.org/).

You can use the `grunt debug` command to livereload the application and the `grunt` command to build it it the `dist` folder.
